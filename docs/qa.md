# Quality Assurance (QA) panels

The `cscal-qa` command generates a summary PNG for each processed flight line. It
combines visual checks and lightweight metadata to confirm that every stage of the
pipeline completed successfully.

When brightness correction is enabled, the accompanying QA JSON includes the
per-band gain and offset emitted by `apply_brightness_correction()` so panel
reviews can confirm illumination normalization values.

QA figures are re-generated on every run so they always reflect the current pipeline
settings. The spectral comparison panel converts reflectance to a unitless 0–1 scale and
shades VIS/NIR/SWIR regions to make interpretation easier.

```bash
cscal-qa --base-folder output_demo
# Optional: write all PNGs to a separate location
cscal-qa --base-folder output_demo --out-dir qa-panels
```

<!-- TODO: Replace this note with an actual QA panel screenshot when available. -->

Each panel validates a specific part of the workflow:

- **Panel A – Raw ENVI RGB:** Verifies that the uncorrected ENVI export opens and renders
  with sensible colors and geospatial orientation.
- **Panel B – Patch-mean spectrum:** Overlays raw vs. BRDF+topo corrected spectra for a
  central patch, highlights VIS/NIR/SWIR wavelength ranges, and plots the difference to
  confirm the correction stage ran.
- **Panel C – Corrected NIR preview:** Displays a high-NIR band from the corrected cube to
  spot striping, nodata gaps, or other artifacts.
- **Panel D – Sensor thumbnails:** Shows downsampled previews of each convolved sensor
  product, confirming the resampling stage produced ENVI bandstacks.
- **Panel E – Parquet summary:** Lists the Parquet sidecars with file sizes so you can check
  that tabular exports were written.

Panels are written to `<flight_stem>_qa.png` inside each flight directory by default. Use
`--out-dir` to aggregate them in a centralized folder for sharing or archival.

## QA Dashboard

You can summarize QA performance across multiple flightlines with a single command:

```bash
cscal-qa-dashboard --base-folder output_fresh
```

This command:

- Aggregates all `*_qa_metrics.parquet` files,
- Computes per-flightline statistics,
- Writes a combined `qa_dashboard_summary.parquet`,
- Generates an overview plot (`qa_dashboard_summary.png`).

Each bar represents the fraction of flagged bands per flightline. Values above `0.25`
(25%) are marked with ⚠️ and may require review.

### ✅ After running

Expected artifacts in `output_fresh/`:

- `qa_dashboard_summary.parquet`
- `qa_dashboard_summary.png`

and log output similar to:

```
📊 Aggregated 12 flightlines (2400 rows)
✅ Computed summary for 12 flightlines
💾 Wrote aggregated QA summary → qa_dashboard_summary.parquet
🖼️ Saved dashboard → qa_dashboard_summary.png

# Quickstart

This is a placeholder Quickstart page for the cross-sensor-cal documentation.

It will be replaced with a detailed getting-started guide that shows how to install the package, run the pipeline on a single NEON flight line, and inspect the outputs.

For now, see the Home page and Tutorials section for more context.

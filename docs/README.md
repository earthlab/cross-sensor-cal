# Documentation

## Overview
This directory hosts project documentation, including the style guide that
defines how you should write and maintain docs across the repository.

## Prerequisites
- A Markdown viewer or editor
- Familiarity with basic Git workflows

## Step-by-step tutorial
1. Review the [documentation style guide](documentation_style_guide.md) to
   understand structure and formatting conventions.
2. Create or update documentation in other folders using the guide's narrative
   approach and examples.
3. After editing, run `pytest` at the repository root to ensure code snippets
   still execute.

## Reference
- `documentation_style_guide.md` â€“ canonical guide for all project docs

## Next steps
Expand this folder with API references, architecture diagrams, or tutorials as
the project evolves.

# Preparing the JOSS submission

This directory contains the materials required for a Journal of Open Source
Software (JOSS) submission.

## Steps

1. Update `paper.md` with finalized author names, affiliations, summary text,
   and validation evidence.
2. Populate `bibliography.bib` with real references and DOIs. Avoid placeholder
   citations in the final submission.
3. Build the paper locally using `joss` tooling (see
   <https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>).
4. Export the generated PDF and verify formatting before uploading to the JOSS
   submission portal.
5. Track outstanding work in `PublicationChecklist.md`.

Cross-Sensor Calibration provides a Python toolkit for harmonizing National Ecological
Observatory Network (NEON) airborne hyperspectral observations across multiple target
sensors. The library automates downloading, radiometric corrections, resampling, and
quality checks so remote-sensing scientists can produce comparable reflectance products
across instruments and campaigns.

## Key features

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Sensor harmonization** ‚Äì resample NEON hyperspectral pixels to alternate
  satellite and airborne sensor response functions.
- üß™ **Processing pipeline** ‚Äì scripted workflow for downloading, masking,
  topographic + BRDF corrections, and spectral library creation.
- üì¶ **Reusable components** ‚Äì composable functions for each stage exposed via the
  `cross_sensor_cal` Python package.
- üìö **Comprehensive documentation** ‚Äì MkDocs site covering architecture, CLI usage,
  troubleshooting, and developer guidance.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (example uses uv, but any tool works)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package with development extras
uv pip install -e .[dev]

# Run the synthetic end-to-end example
python examples/basic_calibration_workflow.py
```

For conda users, we provide a lightweight environment definition in
[`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

## Minimal example

The repository ships with a synthetic calibration workflow that exercises the
core API surface without large data dependencies. Run it directly from the repo
root:

```bash
python examples/basic_calibration_workflow.py
```

The script prints before/after statistics that demonstrate how the synthetic
observations are aligned. See [`examples/basic_calibration_workflow.py`](examples/basic_calibration_workflow.py)
for annotated code and [`docs/examples/basic-calibration-workflow.md`](docs/examples/basic-calibration-workflow.md)
for narrative context. Additional real-world usage patterns are documented in
the [MkDocs User Guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## Installation

Cross-Sensor Calibration targets Python 3.9 or newer and depends on widely used
scientific Python packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, `rasterio`, `spectral`, `hytools`,
etc.). Install from source with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Advanced GDAL/PROJ configuration tips live in the
[installation guide](docs/env-setup.md). When the project publishes wheels to
PyPI the command will simply be `pip install cross-sensor-cal`.

## Documentation

The full documentation site is published at
[earthlab.github.io/cross-sensor-cal](https://earthlab.github.io/cross-sensor-cal/)
with sections for overview material, stage-by-stage tutorials, developer notes,
and an API reference powered by `mkdocstrings`.

## What is cross-sensor calibration?

Cross-sensor calibration ensures measurements collected by different remote
sensing instruments can be compared directly. NEON flight line spectra are
resampled and corrected so that downstream ecological analyses can combine
observations from sensors with varying spectral responses, view angles, and
illumination conditions. This repository provides reusable Python building
blocks for those harmonization steps.

## Citing this software

Please cite the software using the metadata in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).
A minimal BibTeX entry looks like:

```bibtex
@software{cross-sensor-cal,
  author    = {{TODO: Replace with project authors}},
  title     = {Cross-Sensor Calibration},
  year      = {2024},
  publisher = {Earth Lab},
  url       = {https://github.com/earthlab/cross-sensor-cal}
}
```

A DOI-backed citation will be provided after the first Zenodo archived release.

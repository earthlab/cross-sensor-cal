# Cross-Sensor Calibration

Cross-Sensor Calibration provides a Python pipeline for processing NEON Airborne Observation Platform hyperspectral flight lines and resampling them to emulate alternate sensors in a reproducible, scriptable workflow.

## Quickstart

> As of v2.0, cross-sensor-cal no longer depends on HyTools. All NEON handling is internal and GPL-compatible.

Install the lightweight base package:

```bash
pip install cross-sensor-cal
```

Create a workspace and download a flight line:

```bash
mkdir -p data/SITE
cscal-download SITE --year-month 2021-06 --flight FLIGHT_LINE --output data
```

Run the end-to-end processing pipeline (see `--help` for all options):

```bash
cscal-pipeline --help
```

Programmatic invocation is equally simple:

```python
from cross_sensor_cal.pipelines.pipeline import go_forth_and_multiply

go_forth_and_multiply(input_dir="path/to/neon_h5s", output_dir="out_dir")
```

If you need the full geospatial/hyperspectral toolchain (Rasterio, GeoPandas, Spectral, Ray, HDF5),
install the optional extras:

```bash
pip install "cross-sensor-cal[full]"
```

Feature availability by install type:

| Feature | Base | `[full]` |
|---|---|---|
| Core array ops (NumPy/Scipy) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Raster I/O (rasterio) | ⚠️ (not included) | ✅ |
| Vector I/O/ops (GeoPandas) | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| ENVI/HDR (spectral) | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| HDF5 (h5py) | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Ray parallelism | ⚠️ | ✅ |

Replace `SITE` with a NEON site code and `FLIGHT_LINE` with an actual line identifier.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Locate NEON reflectance HDF5 files.** Download or copy the flightline `.h5` files from NEON AOP into your workspace before starting.
2. **Export HDF5 to ENVI (no HyTools).** `neon_to_envi_no_hytools()` opens each file with `NeonCube`, streams spatial tiles, and writes float32 BSQ ENVI rasters plus ancillary angle layers via `EnviWriter`. This stage runs entirely within cross-sensor-cal—no HyTools or Ray runtime dependencies remain.
3. **Fit per-flightline BRDF coefficients.** `fit_and_save_brdf_model()` derives BRDF parameters from the flightline’s sun/sensor geometry and saves them as `<flightline>_brdf_model.json` for reuse.
4. **Apply topographic and BRDF correction.** Tiles from the uncorrected ENVI cube are corrected using slope/aspect rasters and the stored BRDF coefficients (falling back to neutral coefficients with a warning when a JSON is missing or unreadable). An optional `brightness_offset` can be added before writing `<flightline>_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img/.hdr`, whose header includes spatial metadata and true wavelength/FWHM information.
5. **Convolve to simulated sensors.** `convolve_resample_product()` memmaps the corrected cube, multiplies each tile by sensor-specific spectral response functions from `cross_sensor_cal/data/`, and emits one ENVI product per simulated sensor band set.

## Data Products

- **`<flightline>_directional_reflectance.img/.hdr`** – Uncorrected directional reflectance exported from the NEON HDF5 (no topographic, BRDF, or spectral convolution applied). Ancillary angle rasters are written alongside for downstream use.
- **`<flightline>_brdf_model.json`** – JSON coefficients fitted once per flightline; used to drive BRDF correction and defaults to neutral coefficients when unavailable.
- **`<flightline>_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img/.hdr`** – Float32 BSQ cube with both topographic and BRDF corrections applied (and any configured brightness offset). The header preserves spatial metadata plus wavelength lists, FWHM values, and wavelength units that power later resampling steps.
- **`<flightline>_resampled_<sensor>.img/.hdr`** – Simulated multispectral products generated by spectrally convolving the corrected cube with sensor SRFs. These rasters inherit map metadata from the corrected cube but represent only the spectral convolution stage (no additional corrections).

## Install

Cross-Sensor Calibration depends on GDAL, PROJ, Ray, h5py, and optional geospatial stacks such as Rasterio and GeoPandas. We recommend the Conda workflow below because it installs the required native libraries automatically. If you prefer a pure `pip` workflow, install system packages for GDAL/PROJ first (e.g., `brew install gdal` on macOS or `apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev proj-bin` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### Conda

```bash
conda create -n cscal python=3.10 gdal proj
conda activate cscal
pip install -e .
```

### uv/pip

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

If GDAL wheels are unavailable for your platform, install it from Conda-forge and then point `pip` at the Conda environment by exporting `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` and `C_INCLUDE_PATH`.

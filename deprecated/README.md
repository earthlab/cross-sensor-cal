# Deprecated resources

This folder quarantines legacy code, scripts, notebooks, documentation, and tests
that are no longer part of the supported cross-sensor-cal pipeline. The files are
kept temporarily for reference while teams finish migrating to the ENVI-only,
idempotent workflow implemented in `src/cross_sensor_cal/pipelines/pipeline.py`.
They are **not** imported, executed, or covered by CI.

## Layout
- `code/` – HyTools-era exporters, GeoTIFF writers, superseded resampling logic,
  and historical utilities that have been replaced by the modern pipeline.
- `bin/` – Command line entry points that targeted the pre-package repository
  layout. Use the `cscal-*` console scripts instead.
- `docs/` – Documentation describing workflows that produced GeoTIFF deliverables
  or relied on the old module structure. Current docs live under `docs/` at the
  repository root.
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory notebooks and scratch pads that are not part of the
  reproducible processing path.
- `tests_legacy/` – Tests for the retired workflows. Active tests reside in
  `tests/` and validate the ENVI-only pipeline.

The supported deliverables are ENVI `.img/.hdr` pairs produced by the BRDF+topo
corrected pipeline, plus optional `.parquet` sidecars generated in stage 6. GeoTIFF
exports and HyTools-based conversion stages are no longer maintained.

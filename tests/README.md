# Tests

## Overview
Automated tests ensure the calibration workflow behaves as expected. You should
run them before committing changes to verify that new code or documentation
does not break existing functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pytest`

## Step-by-step tutorial
1. Execute all tests from the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```

2. Review the output and fix any failing tests before pushing changes.

## Reference
- `test_file_sort.py` â€“ verifies file sorting and syncing logic

## Next steps
Add new test modules to expand coverage as you develop additional features.

    "\n",
    "Hyperspectral data collected through NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) flight lines provides a high-resolution spectral view of the Earth's surface, capturing detailed information about vegetation, soils, water, and other environmental components. However, the raw NEON data comes in specialized formats that require processing and correction before they can be used for meaningful analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This vignette provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to download, convert, and process NEON flight line data, ensuring efficient memory usage and high data integrity throughout the workflow. Along the way, we will create specific file types needed for both corrections and analysis, bridging the gap between raw hyperspectral data and actionable insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "NEON flight lines are aerial survey paths designed to collect high-resolution spectral data across various ecological sites. These datasets are vital for studying vegetation, soil, water bodies, and other environmental parameters, forming the foundation for many ecological and environmental analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Find Flight Codes**\n",
    "To process NEON flight lines with the `jefe` function, you’ll need the flight codes corresponding to your desired data. Follow these steps to find them:\n",
    "1. **Access the NEON Data Portal:** Visit the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/) to browse available datasets.\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Flight Line Data:** Locate the section for flight line spectral data at your site of interest.\n",
    "3. **Identify Relevant Flight Codes:** Each flight line has associated metadata, including its unique flight code. Record the codes for the lines you wish to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Considerations**\n",
    "1. **Data Availability:**\n",
    "   - NEON’s Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) data is generally available 60 days after the last collection day at a site.\n",
    "   - Data collection schedules may shift due to weather or logistical factors. For the latest updates, consult the [NEON Flight Schedules and Coverage page](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flight-schedules-coverage).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Quality Updates:**\n",
    "   - NEON regularly updates its data products to address quality concerns or implement new processing methods.\n",
    "   - Stay informed about updates or changes that could affect your datasets by checking the [AOP Data Availability Notification](https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/aop-data-availability-notification-release-2024).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Conversion to Multiple Formats:**\n",
    "   - The downloaded folder is processed to generate additional formats required for analysis.\n",
    "   - These files are named systematically to represent the processing step or correction applied. For example:\n",
    "     - **`_envi`:** Reflectance data in ENVI format.\n",
    "     - **`_envi_mask`:** Mask files indicating areas to include or exclude during analysis.\n",

    "     - **`_brdf_coeffs__envi.json`:** Coefficients for BRDF corrections.\n",
    "     - **`_topo_coeffs__envi.json`:** Coefficients for topographic corrections.\n",

    "   - Chunk processing and direct-to-disk writing ensure that memory constraints are respected while maintaining high data fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robust Data Corrections:** \n",
    "   - The inclusion of topographic and BRDF corrections ensures that the processed data is accurate and reliable for downstream analysis, accounting for variability in reflectance and terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperspectral Data for Analysis:** \n",
    "   - The extraction of hyperspectral data from individual pixels provides a valuable resource for detailed numerical and statistical studies, enabling deeper insights into ecological and environmental processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability and Reproducibility:** \n",
    "   - This workflow is scalable to handle additional flight lines, datasets, and sites, making it a versatile tool for researchers working across diverse geographies and ecological systems.\n",
    "   - By following standardized steps and leveraging robust tools, you can ensure that your processing is reproducible and aligned with scientific best practices.\n",
